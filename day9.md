## PANDAS

### Pandas in 10

• What is it?

> Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series

• Object creation - Creating a Series by passing a list of values

• Create a DataFrame by passing a NumPy array

• NumPy arrays have one dtype for the entire array, while pandas DataFrames have one dtype per column

• Operations in general exclude missing data.

• merge() enables SQL style join types along specific columns
