# **What I've learned..**

## Day 1

Today I've learned that there are different kind of text editors. 

==Text Editor==

*text ed·i·tor*

/tekst ˈedədər/
> A text editor does exactly that... edits text! It also manages files as well. There is no such thing as "worlds best text editor" it's more along the lines of what works best for you personally. If the shoe fits WEAR IT! Every text editor has something different that it can offer whether it be a dark background or auto populating something for you. 

==IDE (Integrated Development Environment== 

*in·te·grat·ed  de·vel·op·ment  en·vi·ron·ment*

/ˈin(t)əˌɡrādəd/  /dəˈveləpmənt/  /inˈvīrənmənt/
> The other kind of text editor is labeled as an IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. So not only does this edit your text, it also is a file manager, a compiler and a debugger all in one! If you've ever used Microsoft Outlook, you've used an IDE. You do not require an IDE to write code.

The things I *personally* would look for in a text editor is:
* different themes so it's easy on my eyes
* code completion to reduce typos
* syntax highlighting so my text is easy to read
* a healthy selection of extentions available
