## Linear Regressions

### How to run Linear Regression in Python

> Think of Linear regression as finding the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points

### Key Concepts

• Best Fit- the straight line in a plot that minimizes the deviation between related scattered data points.

• Coefficient – also known as a parameter, is the factor a variable is multiplied by. In linear regression, a coefficient represents changes in a Response Variable.

• Coefficient of Determination – the correlation coefficient denoted as 𝑅². Used to describe the precision or degree of fit in a regression.

• Correlation – the relationship between two variables in terms of quantifiable strength and degree, often referred to as the ‘degree of correlation’.  Values range between -1.0 and 1.0.

• Dependent Feature – a variable denoted as y in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Output, or a Response.

• Estimated Regression Line – the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points.
Independent Feature – a variable denoted as x in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Input, or a predictor.

• Intercept – the location where the Slope intercepts the Y-axis denoted b in the slope equation y=ax+b.

• Least Squares – a method of estimating a Best Fit to data, by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and estimated values.

• Mean – an average of a set of numbers, but in linear regression, Mean is modeled by a linear function.

•Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) – more commonly known as Linear Regression.

• Residual – vertical distance between a data point and the line of regression.

• Regression – estimate of predictive change in a variable in relation to changes in other variables.

• Regression Model – the ideal formula for approximating a regression.

• Response Variables – includes both the Predicted Response (the value predicted by the regression) and the Actual Response, which is the actual value of the data point.

• Slope – the steepness of a line of regression. Slope and Intercept can be used to define the linear relationship between two variables: y=ax+b.

• Simple Linear Regression – a linear regression that has a single independent variable.

> Regression vs Classification: The main difference between regression and classification is that the output variable in regression is continuous, while the output for classification is discrete. Regression predicts quantity; classification predicts labels.

#### Things I want to know more about

I would like to know how to wrap my head around this... I'm not good at math.
