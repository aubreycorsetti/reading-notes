# Markdown Madness!

## What I've learned...

### What is a *Markdown*?
Today I learned that a markdown is a way to use symbols to create the way your site is presented!

#### *For example..*

You can create a header size using on a scale from 1-6 using the # symbol! 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest size. 

*(placement is key! make sure you always place the # symbol FIRST then add a space before any text)*

# Largest Header 
(#)
## Second Largest Header
(##)
###### Smallest Header
(######)

### You can also style/emphisize your text!

#### *Here are a few examples...*

You feel like being **BOLD** simply add 2 ** to both sides of your text.

Anyone else want an *italicized* moment? Add 1 * to both sized of your text!

DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE ~~STRIKINGDOWN~~ , DO YOU EVER FEEL OUT OF PLACE? Add 2 ~~ to both sides of your text.

### How to add an image ðŸ‘€

What would a website be if it didn't have images? To insert an image add ! and wrap the alt text in []followed by the image file in parenthesis ()! EX: [asdjf]( picture link )

![If you see this then I successfully added an image](https://d2kspx2x29brck.cloudfront.net/1200x675/filters:format(webp)/img/iea/yrwQvLJbON/programmer-memes.jpg)

I also learned how to insert... EMOJIS! ðŸ˜„ A simple way to add an emoji is by adding : infront of the desired emoticon!

### Need a list? 

You can make an unordered list by preceeding 1+ lines with * or -
  
* unordered 1
* unordered 2
* unordered 3

To make a numbered list add a number preceeding the text!

1. I'm number one!
2. You're number two!
3. Three's a team! Woo!
