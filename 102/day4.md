## Control Flow

What is Control Flow?

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

*Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.*

### Java Script Functions:

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The code to be executed by the function is placed in curly brackets {}

### Types of JavaScript Operators

There are different types of JavaScript operators:

* Aritmetic Operators: 

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers: + (addition) - (subtraction) * (multiplication) ** (exponentiation) / (division) % (modulus-division remainder) ++ (increment) -- (decrement)

* Assignment Operators:

 The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

* Comparison Operators: 

==	equal to

===	equal value and equal type

!=	not equal

!==	not equal value or not equal type


<	less than

<=	less than or equal to

?	ternary operator

* Logical Operators:

 && logical and

 || logical or

 ! logical not

* Type Operators:

typeof -Returns the type of a variable

instanceof -Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
