# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

## What is it?

> An HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. We can even make sentences/paragraphs stand by themselves. For Example:

### The main parts of our element are

* **The opening tag:** This has the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins.

* **The closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element stops.

* **The content:** This is the content of the element.

* **The element:** The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

### *You can put elements inside other elements!*

## Important code

* **Doctype:** It is a required preamble to make sure your document behaves correctly.
* **HTML element:** This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.
* Head element: This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page. It also includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results.
* Title element: This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.
* Body element: This contains all of your content you want to showcase.
* Heading or h1+: Shows that certain parts of your site are headings/subheadings.

## Semantics

> Is referring to the meaning of a code.. So when referring to the header and its functions its a semantic.

### *Benefits of Semantics*

* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
