Hello! My name is Aubrey Corsetti. I love to paint, build and design things. I can't wait to challenge myself on this new and exciting career path where I can combine many different things I love!

### 🎆 🍹 Cheers to starting something new in 2022! 🍹 🎆

Today I was asked what Growth Mindset is to me... to me that means being open and accepting of all information presented to me. To have willingness to challenge myself and no matter what, keep pushing forward. Everyday there is an opportunity to learn something new that I can apply to my life and myself to become the best version of me that I can be!

### 🌻 Three DAILY reminders that I use to keep my "Growth Mindset" 🌻

  >* ☑️ *...YET!* Always add the word "yet" to any doubts you have. Learning takes time and dedication.
  >* ☑️ Every mistake is an *opportunity* to learn and find the solution.
  >* ☑️ You've been through worse. *Adapt* and grow like you always have.
