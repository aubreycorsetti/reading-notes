Hello! My name is Aubrey Corsetti. I love to paint, build and design things. I can't wait to challenge myself on this new and exciting career path where I can combine many different things I love!

### *What is this site about?*

This site is about everything I have learned during my journey on becoming a software developer! It also is a resource for me to go back and refresh my mind on subjects I have learned but need help with.

### 🎆 🍹 Cheers to starting something new in 2022! 🍹 🎆
