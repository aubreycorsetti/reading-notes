## Debugging

### Troubleshooting JS

1.Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
  > Syntax Error: is a spelling error in your code that causes it to not run.
  > Logic Error: this is an error in your code, it will run but not have accurate results.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

  > I have had a few Syntax errors and I was able to correct it by highlighting the key word I am looking for so I can fix the spelling mistake.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

  > Errors happen all the time! It's important to know how to find the solution to that error so you can have clean, functional code.

### JS Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

  > The JS debugger tool is something that shows you your code in real time and allows you to watch the value of your variables and set breakpoints.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

  > A breakpoint is something that allows you to pause the execution of your code so you can identify the problems that are causing it to execute incorrectly.

3. What is the call stack?

  > A section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line at your breakpoint.
