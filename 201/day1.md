## Things I want to know more about

### Intro to HTML

1. **Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?**
    * It gives your element meaning so we know what its function will be.
2. **How many levels of headings are there in HTML?**
    * There are 6 levels of headings.
3. **What are some uses for the < sup > and < sub > elements?**
    * These are used when marking up items like dates, chemical formula and math equations so they provide the correct meaning.
4. **When using the < abbr > element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?**
    * The title attribute.

### Learn CSS

1. **What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?**
    * There are 3 ways: external stylesheet, internal sylesheet and inline styles.
2. **Why should we avoid using inline styles?**
    * We should avoid it because it makes the code harder to read, oone styling change can require multiple edits so it makes it harder to maintain.
3. **Review the block of code on canvas**

    > 1. *What is representing the selector?*
        * H2
    > 2. *Which components are the CSS declarations?*
        * black and 5px

### Learn JS

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
    * A string
2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

    > * Addition + (add two numbers together or combine two strings)
    > * Assignment = (assigns value to a variable)
    > * Subtraction/Multiplication/Division -,*,/ (basic math)
    > * Strict Equality === (Tests to see if two values are equal. It returns a true or falst result)

3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
    A store sells an apple for $1 and they sell 200 apples. They find out that with each 10 cent increase they lose 2 customers.

4. An if statement checks a condtion and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
5. What is the use of an else if?
   * If the condtion doesn't evaluate to true then it will give you another option to try again for a different result
6. List 3 different types of comparison operators.
    * === and !== check if one value is the same to or not identical to another.
    * < and > check if one value is less than or greater than
    * <= and => check is one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to.
7. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
    * && means AND so you can chain together two or more expressions so that ALL of them evaluate to true individually or together for the expression to return true.
    * || means OR this allows you to chain two or more expressions so that ONE OR MORE of them have to evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
