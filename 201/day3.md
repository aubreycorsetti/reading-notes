# Day 3

## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### Creating Hyperlinks

> 1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

    * we wrap the text around the anchor tag < a > and use an href attribute that is followed by the web link.

> 2. The href attribute contains what information?

    * The href contains the web link.

> 3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

    * Keep your link texts as short as possible

    * Include keywords in your link to clearly describe what the link is to

    * Don't repeat the URL in the description of the link, it looks ugly and is hard to read.

    * Don't use the same verbiage to link texts to multiple different sites.

### CSS Layout

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
    * Normal flow is when you have the basic site layout put together but havent made any changes with CSS yet.

2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
    * Block-level: when the content fills the inline space of the parental element.
    * Inline-Element: is the size of the content

3. **Static** positioning is the default for every html element.

4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
    * We can create isolated UI features that won't interfere with the other parts of the page
    * Using absolute positioning helps specify the distance your element should be from each of the other elements
    * This makes it possible for pop ups to be dragged and placed anywhere on the screen by the user
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
    * Fixed positioning: fixes an element in place relative to the visable portion
    * Absolute postioning: fixes an element in place relative to the closest other elements.

### Learn JS

> 1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
    * Function declartion and function invocation are the same thing. The invocation happens bu including the name of the code somewhere followed by parentheses and function declaration is always hoisted so you can call function above funtion definition and it should work just fine
> 2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    * Parameters are sometimes called funtions

### Misc

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    * Learning from fellow students- Having experienced this on my journey so far I've noticed this has helped me immensly by helping me see so many different scenarios and finding many different solutions to problems I have yet to face as well as problems I have faced during my coding.
    * Work Environment Readiness - I have never been in a tech environment before so knowing the do-s and don't-s of the industry will help me solidify my place and find a job in an environment I can thrive in
