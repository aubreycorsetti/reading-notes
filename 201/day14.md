### CSS Transforms

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

  > * It allows the element to be two or three dimensional with alternative ways to size, position and change elements

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

  > * An example of a trasform is 2D rotate! I could see this being used for a rental website. Allowing the user to see the photo in a different way and giving the illusion of walking around the rental is huge!
