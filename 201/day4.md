# Day 4

## Things I want to know more about

> I would love to learn more about the best way to lay out the order of properties in CSS!

### Readings: Images, Color, Text

> This topic matters to me because this is the visual of your website! I think it's important to have a visually appealing website to make everything clear and easy to navigate.

### HTML Media

1. **What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?**
    > *If someone was visually impaired and the page was being read to them through the computer, the alt attribute would contain a description of the photo! Or if your website wasn't loading the photo uploaded, it would at least have a text description of what should be there.*
2. **How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
    > *By adding alt text and a title*
3. **Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
    > *It would be useful when you have a bunch of photos that you would like a caption for so that the caption you pick for the specified photo. It will semantically link the image to its caption which will help screen readers.*
4. **Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.**
    > *A GIF is for simple image and animation clips.*
    > *An SVG is used for icons, diagrams and things that have to be drawn accurately.*
5. **What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?**
    > *I would say PNG would be the best way to display a screenshot because its a more precise reproduction of your image.*

### Learn CSS

1. **Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.**
    > FOREGROUND: This is used to change the color that your elements text is.
    > BACKGROUND: This is the texts background color.
2. **Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**
    > I personally would change the background color to something bright, yet muted so it doesn't hurt his readers eyes then I would add borders to his different talking sections making each topic a different color. I would also make important key words a bright but easily readable color like red or blue.
3. **What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**
    > That your font needs to be web safe!
4. **What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**
    > Font size controls the size of your text content
    > Font style is used to turn on or off italic.
    > Font weight controls how bold the text is
5. **Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.**
    > You could use:
        * margin

        * font-size

        * text-weight
