## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

  > Because HTTP is stateless, everytime you use then close an app it's state will be reset the next time you open it. But if you close an app on your desktop and re-open it, the most recent state populates.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

  > Personal information

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

  > Local Storage can store string data.You modify it in JS. This is done by using the setItem () and getItem () methods.
