## Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### Why does this topic matter

> This topic matters becuase its having to do with the functionality of your webpage.

### JavaScript Oject Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    > An object is a collection of related data.. Think of it as a bowl. A bowl can contain other things inside of it such as cereal, milk, spoons etc.
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    > Its easier to work with than an array, uses less code.
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
    > Arrays create and store lists of data while objects represent single items with properties.
3. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
    > When an objects property name is held in a variable then you would use brackets to access the value.
4. Evaluate the code in Canvas. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
    > This refers to the dog in the code on canvas. The advantage of using "this" is that it allows you to use the same method definition for all objects you create.

### Introduction to the DOM

1. What is the DOM?
    > DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's a programming interface for web documents. It represents the document as nodes and objects allowing programmings languages to interact with the page.
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
    > JavaScript is the code but uses the DOM to access the documents and elements.
