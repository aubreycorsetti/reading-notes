# Day 2

## HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

### Why does this matter to the module I'm studying

> This matters because this is how a website is fully functional and helps me figure out any errors I come across as well as shortcuts and proper coding techniques for anyone else who has to read my code later on.

### Ordered and Unordered lists

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document? when creating a bulleted list. for example in your NAV/Content catigories.
2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items? Using CSS "list-style-type"
3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document? You should use an ordered list in step by step instructions and use an unordered list to list items.
4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list? use HTML *type* attribute to define the number type or with an li tag

### Learn CSS

1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”? A box is floating in a container. Why is the container floating? Ah-ha! The container has padding. The box noticed that the container  is surrounded by water and is just out of reach from land, theres a margin of water between them. Only by CSS can they touch or never touch again.
2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
    * margins -invisible space around your box
    * borders -drawn between the margin and padding of your box
    * padding -sits between the border and where your content is
    * content -the contents of your site/ what you want people to see

### Learn JS

1. What data types can you store inside of an Array? list like objects aka single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list.
2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why? Yes, you can by giving a single array item a new value.
3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
    * x = f() assigns value
    * x || = f() creates a logical OR assignment
    * x && = f() creates a logical AND assignment
    * x /= f() creates division assignment
    * x *= f() creates multiplication assignment
4. Read the code on canvas and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why. the result would be 10dog because the a evaluates to true and then you're just adding a string at the end of the equation.
5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program. A real world example would be if I took someones coffee order and they asked IF i want cream. IF i say YES then they would put cream in it, but if I say something ELSE like no then they won't put cream in it.
6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript. If you have a prompt or a quesion that needs to be answered correctly before you can continue on the site then a loop is helpful because it will just repeat itselt until it gets the desired response instead of having to write a bunch of seperate coding.
