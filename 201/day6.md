## Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Why is this important

### Domain Modeling

> We need Domain Modeling because it can verify and validate your understanding of a specific problem

### HTML Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

  * They shouldn't be used for page layouts becuase it reduces accessibility, they're not automatically responsive and produce "tag soup".

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >

  * < td > is you tables data inside a row
  * < tr > stops your row from growing
  * < th > goes at the start of a row/column tht esplains the type of datayour column contains.

### Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

  * A constructor is a function called using the new keyword that start with a capital letter. The ad vantages to using it is cleaner and easier code to read, you don't have to repeat your code (DRY).

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

  * Object Literals are singletons while using "this" in a constructor lets us have multiple instances of our object.

### Object Prototype using a Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
  
  * In my previous work experience we had "grooming cards" that allowed us to share our methods of grooming between all other groomers just like a protoypye in a function. When a new groomer gets a grooming card from a previous groomer, they add more information to the card, whether it be the same haircut or different behavioral experience. Just like inheritance in a function!
