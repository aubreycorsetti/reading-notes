# Reading Notes 17

## Intro to Django

### Getting Started with Django

• A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application.

• Djangos template language is flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

• Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

• Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions

• One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.

• Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web applications for particular users according to their preferences

• Django has many security features such as:

> Clickjacking
--------
> Cross-site scripting
--------

> Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
--------

> SQL injection
--------

> Remote code execution
--------
