# Day 26 Notes

## Django Models and Admin

### Django Models

• Represent database tables as python classes

• Defined in the models.py file within a Django app

• Allow fields to be added to the class to specify table columns

• Provide a convenient way to interact with data stored in database using python syntax

• Can inherit from other models, allowing creation of multi-table inheritance structures

• Support data validation and custom behavior through the use of methods and manager classes.

• A model instance represents a database record, and can be saved, updated, or deleted from the database.

### Django Admin

• Django Admin is a built-in interface for managing the data in a Django-powered application.

• It provides a web-based interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data in a database.

• It includes features such as search, filtering, ordering, and pagination, making it easy to manage large amounts of data.

• Django Admin is highly customizable, allowing for easy integration with existing workflows and adding custom functionality.

• It is secure and user authentication is built-in, ensuring only authorized users can access the data.

• It can be used as an internal tool for managing data, or as a public-facing interface for managing content.
