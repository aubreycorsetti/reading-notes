# Reading Notes 01

## Pain vs Suffering

### Pain is the Pain of Growth

• What’s your perspective?

  > My perspective is that there is never an easy road to change your life. Pain is always temporary, time always moves forward. So no matter how much you or I may be struggling, you're already a day and a wake up closer to where you're meant to be.

• Why are you doing this?

  > I'm doing this because I'm tired. I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck with hardly any room for growth. I'm doing this to challenge my mind, body and soul. I want to prove to myself that I am worth it enough to be successful and that I really can do anything I set my mind to.

• Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?

  > I do. I'm ready for my mind to overcome a different challenge everyday. To create something that can be used to improve or change peoples lives.

• Are you doing this for you?

  > I am doing this for myself and my two dogs. They deserve a yard and I deserve to finally have a slice of peace and control in my life.

### Big O Notiation

• Big O, what does it do?
  > It describes worst-case scenarios, and be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

• O(1) - describes an algorithm that will execute at the same time/space regardless of the input data set size.

• O(N) - describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linear and in direct proportion to the data input set size.

• O(N²) - represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.

• O(2^N) - denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

### Things I want to know more about

• I want to learn more about all of this! Python, Big O notation etc.
