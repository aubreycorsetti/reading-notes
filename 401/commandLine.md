## Terminal

### The Command Line

• What is it?
  > A command line also known as a terminal, is a text based interface system. You are able to enter commands by typing on the keyboard.
  > A quick break down:
    Line 1: presents us with a prompt and after that we enter a command.
    Lines 2-5: Output from running the command
    Line 6: Presents us with prompt again.
 **Your terminal most likely won't have numbers on it**

### The Shell, Bash

• Your terminal is also known as a shell. It helps define how your terminal will behave and look after executing commands for you.

• The most common one is called *bash* which stands for Bourne again shell.

### Basic Navigation

• To locate where you are, enter pwd (this stands for print working directory)
• To find out what is in the location you are currently at type in ls.
• to change directories type in cd (this stands for change directory).
• There are two paths in your terminal, relative and absolute.
  > Relative path is a file/directory location relative to where you currently are in the file system.
  > Absolute path is a file/directory location in relation to the root if the file system.

### More about Files

• Linux is case sensitive, anything inside of a quote is considered a single item

• file
  >obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

•ls -a
  > List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

### Manual Pages

• Manual pages are a set of pages explaining every command available on your system including what they do. You use this by entering man < command to look up > in your terminal.

• man -k < search term >
  > Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.

• /< term >
  > Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'

• n
  > After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.

### File Manipulation

• To create a new directory, use command mkdir

> Reminders
  • No undo
    > The Linux command line does not have an undo feature. Perform destructive actions carefully.
