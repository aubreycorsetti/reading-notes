# Day 1 Notes

## Prep: Data Structures and Algorithms

### Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

  > The more important things to consider is what are the operations to be performed and how often will they be executed?

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

  > add a base case, ex: if i <= 1: return
    else: countdown (i-1)

### Things I want to know more about

> I want to know more about all of this seeing as I dont have any outside/prior experience other than code fellows!
