### Measuring Emotional Intelligence

• The results of this test deemed me emotionally in tune. I will say I do agree, I am human though so I know and accept that sometimes and somedays will not be my best. I am always looking to improve and grow as a person though and I feel that is what matters most.

### Assessing Bias

• According to the results, I have high-self awareness. The areas I am strongest are Empathy and Curiosity, What is Bias, Meaningful Connections and Four ways to act with Courage. The areas I am weakest is Bias and Identity. The main part that I will be working on is really allowing myself to show through my work.
