# Day 20 Notes

## Readings: Django Custom User

### Django Custum User Model

â€¢ There are two ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser.

> Requirements/Setup:

- update django_project/settings.py

- create a new CustomUser model

- create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm

- update the admin

-Within INSTALLED_APPS add accounts at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.

- We need new versions of two form methods that receive heavy use working with users. Stop the local server with Control+c and create a new file in the accounts app called forms.py.

-set the redirect links for log in and log out, which will both go to our home template. Add these two lines at the bottom of the file.

-Create a new project-level templates folder and within it a registration folder as that's where Django will look for the log in template. Put your signup.html template in there.

-create four templates using either the touch command on macOS or your text editor on Windows.

### DjangoX
