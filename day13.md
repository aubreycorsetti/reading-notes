# Day 13 Notes

## Serverless Functions

### What is Serverless Computing

• Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that allows devs to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backends!

• Allows devs to focus writing the best front-end application code.

• Cloud provider does the rest! It also is responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance i.e operating system updates/patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring etc.

> *Serverless does not mean 'no servers'*

• 'Serverless' describes the devs experience with those servers, they are invisible to the dev.

• **Serverless databases and storage:** Databases (SQL and NoSQL) and storage (particularly object storage) are the foundation of the data layer. A serverless approach to these technologies involves transitioning away from provisioning “instances” with defined capacity, connection and query limits, and moving toward models that scale linearly with demand in both infrastructure and pricing.

• **Event streaming and messaging:** Serverless architectures are well-suited for event-driven and stream-processing workloads most notably the open source Apache Kafka event streaming platform.

• **API gateways:** API gateways act as proxies to web actions and provide HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, viewing API usage, viewing response logs, and API sharing policies.
