  > Resource(s)

• What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.

  > A URI - EX: https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

• • What are the most common HTTP verbs?

  > GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE

• What should the URIs be based on?

  > Nouns (the resources)

• Give an example of a good URI.

  > https://adventure-works.com/orders 

• What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

  > It means to have a large number of requests, it's a bad thing to overload your API.

• What status code does a successful GET request return?

  > GET method returns an HTTP status code 200(OK).

• What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

  > 404 (Not Found) or 204 (No Content)

• What status code does a successful POST request return?

  > 201 (Created)

• What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

  > 204 (No Content)
