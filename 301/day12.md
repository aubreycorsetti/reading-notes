# Day 12 Notes

## More CRUD

### CRUD Basics

• Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?

  > You would use PUT

• Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

> Put requires ID parameters

### Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

• What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

  > CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands.

• If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

  > 1. Define your requirements
  > 2. APR architecture
  > 3. Responses and error messages
  > 4. Endpoint
  > 5. Documentation

### Things I want to know more about

> I would like to get more comfortable with how to build APIs
