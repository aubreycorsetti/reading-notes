# Day 1 Reading Notes

## State and Props

### React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

  • Render happens first.

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

  • constructor then static getDerivedStateFromProps()

3.Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

  • constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount

4. What does componentDidMount do?

  • allows us to execute React when component is placed in the DOM.

### React State vs Props

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

  • arguments, title/sub titles

2. What is the big difference between props and state?

  • props you pass into a component, state handled inside of component

3. When do we re-render our application?

  • when there is a change in their state or props

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

  • shopping lists, purchased products, forms, anything that has an updating value etc
