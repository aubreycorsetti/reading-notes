# Day 13 Notes

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

• What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

  > Personal computers were introduced to homes.

• Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

  > Mostly everything to do with computers were marketed to men and boys which led to the narrative of *"computers are only for boys"*

## Employee Breakdown of Key Technology Companies

• When are diversity efforts most successful?

  > When they are driven by a commitment from the company leaders.

• Why do diverse companies perform better?

  > Because they are able to see things from so many different perspectives and bring different techniques of organization and problem solving.

• Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

  > "When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result."

### Things I want to know more about

> I would love to learn more about women in tech because I feel it's still a fairly male dominated career field.
