# Day 10 Notes

## MongoDB and Mongoose

### NoSQL vs SQL

• 5 Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

  > 1. SQL databases are called Relational Databases whereas NoSQL databases are non-relational or distributed databases
  > 2. SQL db have predefined schema whereas NoSQL db have dynamic schema for unstructured data
  > 3. SQL db are table based db whereas NoSQL db are document based, key value pairs, graphs or wide column stores.
  > 4. SQL db are vertically scalable whereas NoSQL db are horizonatally scalable
  > 5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

• What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

  > open-source

• Give a real world example.

  > Health care provider databases use SQL

• What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

  > document based

• Give a real world example.

  > New York Times uses NoSQL

• Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

  > NoSQL

• Which type of database is best for scalability?

  > SQL

### SQL vs NoSQL (video)

• What does SQL stand for?

  > Structured Query Language

• What is a relational database?

  > Relational db is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

• What type of structure does a relational database work with?

  > tables, rows and columns

• What is a ‘schema’?

  > a drawn concept that helps organize and interpret information

• What is a NoSQL database?

  > document based/ non tabular db that stores data

• How does it work?

  > NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables. Accordingly, we classify them as “not only SQL” and subdivide them by a variety of flexible data models. Types of NoSQL databases include pure document databases, key-value stores, wide-column databases, and graph databases.

• What is inside of a MongoDB database?

  > data records as documents which are gathered together in collections. Theyre typically BSON documents.

• Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

  > MongoDB is more flexible. It ensures high and diverse data availability

• What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

  > They don't support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.
