# Day 8 Notes

## Functional Programming

### Functional Programming Concepts

• What is functional programming?

  > Funtional programming is a programming paradigm (style fo building the structure/elements of comp. programs) that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

• What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

  > A pure funtion returns the same result if givin the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects.

• What are the benefits of a pure function?

  > Easier to test code

• What is immutability?

  > Definition: Unchanging over time or unable to be changed

• What is Referential transparency?

  > If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

### Node JS- Modules and Require()

• What is a module?

  > A module is another JS file

• What does the word ‘require’ do?

  > It brings in modules and returns the exports object

• How do we bring another module into the file that we are working in?

  > const example = require('./example');

• What do we have to do to make a module available?

  > module.exports = example;

### Things I want to know more about
