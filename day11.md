# Day 11 Notes

## Data Visualization

### IPython

> Is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has a lot of interesting fetures including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging, etc.

### Pyplot

> Pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

### Matplotlib

• Comes with a set of default settings that allows customization of many different properties. It's a lot like the CSS of data.

• spines are the lines connecting the axis tick marks, they note the boundaries of the data area.

• A legend is a keyword argument

• You can use the annotate command to display text with an arrow

• A figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure#" as the title. Firgures are numbered starting from 1.

• With subplot you can arrange plots in a regular grid.

• Axes are similar to subplots but allow you to place another plot within the figure at any location.

• You can animate! The easiest way to make an animation in matplotlib is to declare a FuncAnimation object that specifies to matplotlib what is the figure to update, what is the update function and what is the delay between frames.

#### Things I want to know more about

I want to learn how to do this to make data look fun, animated and pretty!
